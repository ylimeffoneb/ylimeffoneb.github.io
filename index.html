<h1>Emily's Website</h1>

<p>I made a website! Here is a <em>cool</em> video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3mb3Ya9OUc&t=205s">Alan Lomax talking about Sacred Harp!</a> Alan Lomax collected a <strong>historic</strong> archive of American folk songs.</p>

<p>Lomax is accredited with bringing the music of singers such as Lead Belly, Pete Seeger, and Woodie Guthrie to a popular audience. He traveled around the United States documenting regional folk music traditions; in the process, he produced thousands of significant feild recordings that were subsequently preserved in the Library of Congress's Archive of Folk Song, where he served as the Archivist. Here is a video of one of my favorite Lomax <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoJkndLVcqM">recordings </a> with Appalachian folk singer Roscoe Holcomb. Before moving to LA, I lived in Maryland and went for many hikes and drives through Appalachia. I listened to Lomax's Appalachian recordings a lot during that time.</p>

<p> <em>I'd love to travel around and make my own field recordings one day!</em>
